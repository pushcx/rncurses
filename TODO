This is the complete list of functions present in ncurses that have not yet
been wrapped by ncurses-ruby:

terminfo functions: setupterm, setterm, set_curterm, del_curterm, restartterm,
                    tparm, tputs, vidputs
termcap fuctions:   tgetent, tgetflag, tgetnum, tgetstr, tgoto
scanw functions:    scanw, wscanw, mvscanw, mvwscanw, vwscanw
v*printw functions: vw_printw, vwprintw
ncurses
kernel functions:   ripoffline

If you need any of these, then implement them and send me a patch.  If the
function that you need is ripoffline, or *scanw, then please get in contact
with me before implementing it (see file README for my adress).
