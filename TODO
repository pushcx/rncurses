The ACS_* constants are currently implemented as constants of module "Ncurses".
These constants are initialized during the call to Ncurses::initscr.  This
means they are not usable for programs that open terminals using newterm.
These programs would need the following implementation of these constants:
The constants' names would be instance methods of class Ncurses::SCREEN.
When such a method is invoked, the ruby wrapper code would first invoke
set_term setting the SCREEN instance as the current screen, then read
the ACS_* entry from acs_map, restore the current terminal to the old SCREEN,
and return the ACS_* value.

This is the complete list of functions present in ncurses that have not yet
been wrapped by ncurses-ruby:

terminfo functions: setupterm, setterm, set_curterm, del_curterm, restartterm,
                    tparm, tputs, vidputs
termcap fuctions:   tgetent, tgetflag, tgetnum, tgetstr, tgoto
scanw functions:    scanw, wscanw, mvscanw, mvwscanw, vwscanw
v*printw functions: vw_printw, vwprintw
ncurses
kernel functions:   ripoffline

If you need any of these, then implement them and send me a patch.
