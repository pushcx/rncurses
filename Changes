ncurses-ruby-1.1
* Bugfixes by T. Sutherland in _tracef and _tracedump.

ncurses-ruby-1.0
* Mousemask bugfix from P.Duncan.
* Solved timing problems that affected visual smoothness of reactions
  to user input
* Each SCREEN got back its own "halfdelay" and "cbreak" settings

ncurses-ruby-0.9.2
 * Preventing getch and wgetch functions from blocking other ruby threads.
 * Previously ncurses-ruby installed two files named "ncurses.rb" and
   "ncurses.so". The "ncurses.so" is now renamed to "ncurses_bin.so"
   to prevent "require 'ncurses'" from accidentally loading only the
   binary file in case that this is found first in ruby's load path.
 * Reintroduced ability to "include" Ncurses functions:
   Use "include Ncurses::Namespace" for that. This is implemented via
   method_missing, so that ncurses functions (some of which have very
   common names) will not hide other functions defined in the extended
   scope. (Any existing method_missing function is properly aliased and
   called after an unsuccessful lookup.)

ncurses-ruby-0.9.1
 * Bugfix in *in*str functions (Hiroshi Sainohira)
 * Fix linking error on Mac OS X and some other platforms (Andreas Schwarz)

ncurses-ruby-0.9:
 * Forms wrapper contributed by Simon Kaczor
 * ncurses-ruby now also works with ncurses-4.2
   (an old release from 1998, needed for Zaurus-port)
 * First binary package for Sharp Zaurus (arm-linux)

ncurses-ruby-0.8:
 * Bugfix: Calls into the ncurses library prior to calling
   Ncurses::initscr or Ncurses::newterm had previously crashed
   the Ruby interpreter.
   Fixed by delaying the binding of most Ncurses functions
   until after Ncurses::initscr or Ncurses::newterm have been
   called.
 * Replaced module functions with singleton functions. This
   means that
     include Ncurses
     initscr
   is no longer possible. Instead, use
     Ncurses.initscr
   Reasons: - Consistency. The shortcut has never been possible
              with all ncurses functions.
            - Namespace pollution. Some ncurses functions have
              too common names.

ncurses-ruby-0.7.2:
 * reintroduced Ncurses::pechochar and Ncurses::redrawwin in the ncurses build.
   These had been removed by mistake because they did not work with PDCurses.
