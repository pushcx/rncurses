    <h2>About ncurses</h2>
    <p>
      ncurses is a C library with fuctions for manipulating text screens.
      Thus, it is useful for programmers who write interactive applications
      that have to run in text terminals.
      ncurses is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html"
		    >abailable here</a> as a
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a> software package.
      Ncurses provides functions for input and output from and to text
      terminals (providing random access to any screen coordinate),
      and embeds these functions into a framework of rectangular regions on the
      screen.
    <p>
      If you want to learn more about ncurses, then you can either read 
    <ul>
      <li>
	the ncurses-intro text that is included in the ncurses distribution
	(a copy of ot is
	<a href="http://dickey.his.com/ncurses/ncurses-intro.html">available
	  here</a>),
      <li>
	a few sections from the ancient Linux Programmer's Guide, starting
	<a href="http://linuxdoc.org/LDP/lpg/node97.html">here</a>,
	or

    </ul>
    You will need a basic understanding of ncurses if you want to use the
    ncurses-ruby module, since it is a wrapper of the underlying C library.
    <h2>About ncurses-ruby</h2>
    <p>
      This ruby extension makes most functions, constants, and external variables
      of the C library
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses</a>
      accessible from the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby
      programming language</a>.
    <p>
      All C functions are wrapped by module functions of a the module
      "Ncurses", with exactly the same name.
      Additionally, C functions expecting a
      WINDOW* as their first argument can also be called as methods of the
      "Ncurses::WINDOW" class.
    <p>
      The panel library (for support of overlapping windows) is also wrapped,
      in the module "Ncurses::Panel".
    <p>

      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt"> GNU Lesser General Public
      License, Version 2.1 or later</a>.

    <h2>Using ncurses-ruby on a windows system</h2>
    <p>
      ncurses works well in a <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a>
      environment on windows. If your version of the ruby interpreter was
      compiled with cygwin, you can easily use the ncurses library provided
      by the cygwin project to compile ncurses-ruby.
      
    <p>
      If you'd rather use a non-cygwin version of ruby, you may be able to
      get ncurses-ruby running together with the
      <a href="pdcurses.sourceforge.net">PDCurses library</a>.
      The ncurses-ruby source package contains a description
      how to compile ncurses-ruby for a
      <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>-compiled ruby interpreter.
    <p>
      In the
      <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/filelist.php?group_id=273">
	Download area</a>, there is also a precompiled ncurses-ruby Package
      to use with a <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>-compiled ruby.
    <h2>Going further</h2>
    <p>
      This BerliOS project aims at more than wrapping ncurses. The goal is to
      provide a <em>Textmode User Interface Application Framework</em> on the
      basis of the ncurses wrapper.
      Ncurses enables applications to manipulate text terminals, but it still
      requires a lot of work from the programmer to build user interfaces from
      that.
    <p>
      Such a framework would provide <em>User interface Widgets</em> like push
      buttons, checkboxes, menubars etc, and also an event-driven callback
      framework.
      Imagine something like Borland's "Turbo Vision" framework implemented in
      ruby.
    <p>
      To learn more about the requirements of what such a framework, I plan
      to implement a
      <a href="tvision-ruby.html">ruby wrapper for turbo vision</a>.
