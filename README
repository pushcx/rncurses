This wrapper provides access to the functions, macros, global variables and
constants of the ncurses library.  These are simply mapped to a Module named
Ncurses.  Functions and external variables are implemented as module functions
of the Module Ncurses.

If you don't know how to use ncurses from C, then stop reading here, and read
an introduction to ncurses. Eric Raymond has written an introduction that
should be part of the ncurses development package installed on your computer.
If you need a gentler introduction, then you have two options:
(1) there is a part of a chapter in the linux programmer's guide dealing with
    ncurses, available from www.linuxdoc.org.  It should be quite old by now,
    but the ncurses interface has not changed since then, regarding the scope
    of covered functions, so it is still a very good read.
(2) There is also a quite up-to-date "NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO" in the HOWTO
    collection of the Linux Documentation Project, also available at
    www.linuxdoc.org, which is worth a read.

You will also appreciate the extensive man-pages of ncurses.


Installation and Usage
======================

ruby extconf.rb
make
make install

In your programs:
require "ncurses.rb"


External Variables
==================

External variables are accessed read-only, by module functions taking no
arguments.  They are spelled exactly like their C counterparts, which leads to
module functions beginning with an uppercase letter (e.g. Ncurses.LINES).

One of these external variables, ESCDELAY, is also settable with a ruby method
(Ncurses.ESCDELAY=).


Constants
=========
(static C Preprocessor macros)

Constants are implemented as module functions in the Ncurses module, if
possible. Ruby constants can not start with an underscore, so these constants
have been renamed (they lost the leading underscore). There are,however,
module functions with the same name as these constants, that also return
the constant's value, when invoked (e.g. "Ncurses._ENDLINE" returns the value
of the constant "Ncurses::ENDLINE", which has the same value as the C constant
"_ENDLINE").

The ncurses macros starting with ACS_ are not really constants, their value
depends on the terminal in use.  Nevertheless, they are implemented as
constants of the Ncurses module, but since they depend on the terminal, they
are not initialized before initscr() has been called. If you need more than
one terminal in a single program, you can access the ACS_ values through member
functions of class SCREEN.


Functions
=========

Functions (also those only implemented by macros in C) can also be accessed
through module functions of the Module Ncurses. They take exactly the same
arguments as their C counterparts. Some of the C functions return additional
arguments through pointer arguments. These are implemented as follows:


Functions expecting pointers to integer types
---------------------------------------------

When the C-function expects a pointer to int, short, chtype, or attr_type,
You should use as the argument to the ruby function a variable containing
an empty array. This is because ruby passes these types (ints) by value instead
of by reference; but arrays are passed by reference, so that you can see
changes in them, performed by the function.
Attention: some macro-only functions like getsyx accept variables of type int,
but, being macros, they write values to their arguments. Thus, they also need
empty array arguments when called from ruby.
Example: 
	color_pair_number = 4
	foreground_color  = []
	background_color  = []
	if (Ncurses.pair_content(color_pair_number, foreground_color,
			         background_color) != Ncurses::ERR)
	  "color pair number #{color_pair_number} contains color number " +
	  "#{foreground_color[0]} as the foreground color, and color "    +
	  "number #{background_color[0]} as the background color")
	end

There are 2 functions that read a value from the location ponted to by a
pointer to int, and store another value at those locations. These functions are
mouse_trafo and wmouse_trafo. When calling these functions, you have to provide
2 arrays, each filled with exacly one Integer. The values contained in these
arrays will then be changed by the ruby module function.


Functions expecting (non-const) pointers to char
------------------------------------------------

When the C-function expects a pointer to char, you should use a variable
containing an empty string as the argument to the ruby function.
Example:
	line2 = ""
	if (Ncurses.mvwinnstr(Ncurses.stdscr, y=2, x=0, line2,
			      Ncurses.getmaxx(Ncurses.stdscr)) == Ncurses::ERR)
		raise "could not scan 3rd line"
	else
		Ncurses.beep if line2.index("|")
	end
The string that the C function would store at the pointer-to-char location
will be appended to the given string.

Functions expecting const pointers to char do not modify the string they
receive, you can pass any string to them.



Functions expecting pointers to structs
---------------------------------------------------

When the C-function expects a pointer to WINDOW, SCREEN, MEVENT or PANEL, then
simply pass it the corresponding, already existing ruby object.


Module / Class Hierarchie
=========================

module Ncurses
	class WINDOW; end
	class SCREEN; end
	class MEVENT; end
	module Panel
		class PANEL; end
	end
end


Where to find the functions
===========================

As stated, all ncurses functions are implemented as module functions in the
module Ncurses. When you know how an ncurses function is named in C (example:
"mvaddch"), you can simply call the corresponding module functions with the
same number of arguments (example: "Ncurses.mvaddch(y,x,ch)")

The class window implements method_missing and tries to map invoked methods
to Ncurses module functions using a simple heuristic:
If the method name starts with "mv", it looks for a Ncurses module function
that starts with "mvw", and if it exists, adds itself to the argument list
and calls this function.
If no such module function exists, or the name of the invoked method does not
start with "mv", it looks if there is a module function with the name "w" +
methodname, and if it exists, adds itself again to the argument list and calls
this function.
If this module function did not exist either, then, as a last step, it invokes
a module function with the same name as the method, adding itself to the
argument list.

So, if you invoke win.mvaddch(y,x,ch) on an Ncurses::WINDOW object, it will
delegate the method call as Ncurses.mvwaddch(win,y,x,ch), which is what you
probably wanted.

Other examples:
 win.delwin()        =>  Ncurses.delwin(win)          # win cannot be used
                                                      # after this call
 win.printw("hello") =>  Ncurses.wprintw(win, "hello")
 win.getmaxyx(y=[],
              x=[])  =>  Ncurses.getmaxyx(win,y,x)


Example programs
================

Directory "examples" contains a few example programs demonstrating how to use
the library with ruby.  Be sure to read the file
"examples/LICENSES_for_examples".


The panel library
=================

The panel library has also been wrapped. All panel functions are implemented
as module functions of the module Ncurses::Panel.

Most of these functions are also implemented as methods of class
Ncurses::Panel::PANEL, once with the original name and once with the subword
"panel" and an adjacent underscore removed.
